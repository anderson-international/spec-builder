# Implementation Boundaries Rule

When implementing a feature:

1. Strictly adhere to the scope defined in the planning phase
2. Prioritize functionality over UI enhancements unless explicitly requested
3. Avoid adding user-facing controls or displays not specified in requirements
4. When in doubt about a feature's inclusion, ask for explicit confirmation
5. Focus on robust implementation of core functionality before considering extensions

This rule ensures development remains focused on solving the specific problems outlined in requirements without unnecessary scope expansion.
