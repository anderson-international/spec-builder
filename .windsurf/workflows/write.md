description: Switch to write mode
---

We are now in write mode until I instruct you otherwise.

In this mode I expect you to edit the code files directly. Do not output your code into the chat window.

I do not want you to attempt to run any command line commands in your own terminal window. Instead, you must output the command so that I can copy it and run it manually. The commands must be formatted correctly for the windows command line tool only.

If you are confident your changes are correct, then go ahead and implement them. Do not stop to ask permission unless you need additional information. For example, do not ask the question: "Ready to proceed with this change?" Assume that I am ready to proceed because we are in write mode.
