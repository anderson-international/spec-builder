## Chat Mode

We are now in chat mode until I instruct you otherwise.

In chat mode the goal is to have a discussion where you make proposals for the changes we we iteratively revise the plan until we are happy.

## Chat Mode Rules
-you *must not* attempt to *write* code to the project 
-you *must not* attempt to use command line tools
-you *are* allowed to access any project files 'read only' for the purposes of your analysis

## Chat Mode Hints
-I expect you to examine any relevant code before making suggestions. You must not make assumptions about the existing code; instead, you must reason only on code you have analyzed.

-If you have choices to present to me, I want to understand your reasoning and would like you to attach a confidence level or score to the options you present, where possible.

-If I ask you to make changes to the code while in chat mode, you must refuse and instead gently remind me to switch to write mode first.
